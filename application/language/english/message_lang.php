$lang["abstract_project"] = "ICT support for learning can benefit a large number of people, facilitate the reuse of educational materials and the application of different teaching strategies. An important part of the research is oriented to the design and creation of OA Learning Objects and Repositories that allow their exchange.
The strategy of educational content in small entities is a significant advance in the production of OA, but this alone is not enough. Its real usefulness requires that these objects are compatible with different environments and learning management systems, easy to migrate from one platform to another, easy to locate, access, archive and re-use. Hence the importance of establishing standards for the design and description of LOs. The potential benefits of the AO Repositories are reuse, interoperability, durability and accessibility.
The project aims to define and validate which are the characteristics and technologies that effectively enable the storage and retrieval of reusable OAs and that can aim to participate in national and international OA Repository Federations. It is proposed to develop a model for the creation in Colombia of a set of repositories of federated LOs that allow the sharing of these resources through the definition of policies, methodological bases and processes of construction and administration of LOs and repositories, based on international standards and free software.";
